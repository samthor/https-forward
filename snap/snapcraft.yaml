summary: A forwarding HTTPS server using Let's Encrypt
license: Apache-2.0
description: "Provides a forwarding HTTPS server which transparently fetches and caches certificates via Let's Encrypt. This must run on 443 and 80 (just forwards to https://) and can't coexist with any other web server on your machine.

**Why?** This is so you can host random and long-lived services publicly on the internetâ€”perfect for _other_ services which don't care about certificates or HTTPS at all, and might be provided by Node or Go on a random high port (e.g., some dumb service running on `localhost:8080`).

**Note!** This doesn't magic up domain names. You would use this service only if you're able to point DNS records to the IP address of a machine you're running this on, and that the machine is able to handle incoming requests on port 443 and 80 (e.g., on a home network, you'd have to set up port forwarding on your router).

Configure this via `/var/snap/https-forward/common/config`, which is empty after install. It should be authored like this:

   # hostname            forward-to          optional-basic-auth
   host.example.com      localhost:8080
   blah.example.com      192.168.86.24:7999  user:pass
   user-only.example.com localhost:9002      user       # accepts any password
   
   # ... specify host with '.' to suffix all following
   .example.com
   test                  localhost:9000
   under-example         any-hostname-here.com:9000

(example.com used above purely as an _example_.
You'd replace it with a domain name you controlled, preferably with a wildcard DNS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_DNS_record) record.)

Restart with `snap restart https-forward` to reread the config file. You can read logs to ensure that the file has been parsed properly:

   sudo journalctl -u snap.https-forward.https-forward
